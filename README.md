# Bone-Fracture-Classification-System-Using-Deep-Learning
# Abstract
Bone fracture classification is a critical task in the medical field, requiring expert analysis to
identify the type and severity of fractures. This study presents a computer vision-based
system utilizing deep learning for automatic classification of bone fractures from X-ray
images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was implemented to classify
fractures into ten categories, including avulsion fractures, comminuted fractures, and spiral
fractures. The model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the validation dataset, demonstrating
its potential to assist healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate
diagnoses.
